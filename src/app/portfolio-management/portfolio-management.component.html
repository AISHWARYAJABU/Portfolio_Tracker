          <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> One of the primary objectives of portfolio management is to manage risk
            effectively. Diversification is a key strategy used
            to reduce risk by spreading investments across different asset classes and industries.</li>

          <li><strong>Maximizing Returns:</strong> Portfolio managers aim to maximize returns on investments while
            balancing
            risk. They seek to achieve the highest
            possible returns within the risk constraints defined by the investor.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Asset Allocation:</strong> Asset allocation involves distributing investments across different asset
            classes, such as equities, fixed income, real
            estate, and cash. The goal is to create a balanced portfolio that aligns with the investor's risk tolerance
            and
            financial goals.</li>
